## Features

- **Automated Data Extraction:** Seamlessly scrape data from multiple web pages.
- **Intelligent Parsing:** Use AI to interpret and structure the scraped content.
- **Customizable:** Easily configure scraping parameters and targets.
- **Data Storage:** Save extracted data in various formats, including CSV, JSON, and databases.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.7+** (Recommended)
- **Libraries:** 
  - `requests`
  - `beautifulsoup4`
  - `pandas`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `nltk`
  - Any other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-web-scraper.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```sh
   cd ai-web-scraper
   ```

3. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment:**

   ```sh
   python -m venv env
   ```

   On Windows:

   ```sh
   .\env\Scripts\activate
   ```

   On macOS/Linux:

   ```sh

   ```

4. **Install Required Packages:**

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Configure Scraping Settings:**

   Edit the `config.json` file to specify the URLs and parameters for scraping.

2. **Run the Scraper:**

   ```sh
   python scraper.py
   ```

   By default, the scraped data will be saved to `data/output.csv`. You can adjust the output settings in the `config.json` file.

3. **Analyze the Data:**

   After scraping, use the provided analysis scripts or integrate the data into your own analysis pipeline.

## Configuration

The `config.json` file contains settings for the web scraper. Example:

```json
{
  "urls": [
    "https://example.com/page1",
    "https://example.com/page2"
  ],
  "output_format": "csv",
  "max_pages": 10
}
```

## Development
